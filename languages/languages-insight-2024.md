## Introduction
<!-- ********************* -->

As time passes, inexorably new paradigms emerge. Intelligence doesn't stay stale. It moves in time and place.

Computer languages have always been the hot bed of new thought.

I wanted to take stock of where languages are, recently (2024).

Few questions I want to explore are:

1. Why are there so many new languages lately? Or are there that many?
2. If there are, what are they?
3. General purpose languages vs specialized languages?
4. Front end vs backend languages?
5. What are the key features and advantages of the newer specialized languages?
6. If I were to retool, how should I consider these new languages?
7. What are some programming languages to watch out for?
8. What is the likely hood of their future adoption?
9. Whcih ones should you care about?
10. How simple or hard is the learning curve for these languages?
11. Am I missing something if I am not aware of the advancement in these newer languages?

# Languages with explicit memory management, or No GC
<!-- ********************* -->

These are

```
Rust
C++
C
```

No garbage collector (GC) systems are of interest for performance, predictability, and when control over resources are critical.

1. Performance and predictability
2. Explicit Memory management
3. Concurrency and multi-threading
4. Bringing it all together, a systems programming case


<!-- ********************* -->
# My brief Take
<!-- ********************* -->

Few languages on my radar, some immediately, and perhaps some soon.

## Python

Significant inroads in 

1. Data and analysis (via Pandas, Numpy, Graphics libs)
2. AI (Pytorch, GenAI, RAG)
3. Becoming a main lingua franca

## TypeScript

This is now universal. Especially in front end applications (angular, react, etc.), or as part of the node.js server ecosystem. 

## Dart

Due to Google's flutter as a mobile strong platform.

## Rust

It is really hard to write large systems and frameworks in a "fault tolerant" way. Rust seem to uniquely focusing on it with compile time checking along with additional features. This may be a compelling reason to look at it for large fault tolerant systems.

I suspect, however putting such explicit control on memory management, won't it create issues for average programmers?

## ELixir

I am curious, how and when concurrency can be a deciding factor? A bit cautious of its alternate programming model of Erlang.

## Mojo

1. It is python compatible
2. Apparently applicable in AI applications

## PowerShell

1. I love this language.
2. Hoping to use it to automate windows OS and cloud
